1. url - the address where the api is hosted
2. Request type - the http protocol:
   1. GET - return information from an API
   2. POST - sends data you have entered and returns a confirmation that the data you sent was received
   3. PATCH and PUT - sends data that modifies a record that an API has access to
   4. DELETE - deletes a record that an API has access to
3. Authentication - the credentials required to access api endpoints

## endpoint
