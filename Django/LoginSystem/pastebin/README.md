# PASTEBIN

in this application someone should:

be able to paste some text
allow users to edit and delete the text
be able to view all texts.
clean up texts older than a day

when you want to redirect to another url after a successful save in django, let's say you are creating a new object, you go to where you have defined your views, to the view we are redirecting from and then you add the line `success_url = reverse_lazy("the url").
