# Decorators

Decorators help to convey a message depending on the user’s action or customize the look and feel of a widget. There are different types of decorators for each task.

1. Decoration —The base class to define other decorations.
2. BoxDecoration —Provides many ways to draw a box with border, body, and boxShadow.
3. InputDecoration —Used in TextField and TextFormField to customize the border, label, icon, and styles. This is a great way to give the user feedback on data entry, specifying a hint, an error, an alert icon, and more.
