# Animation

flutter has two types of animations:

1. physics-based animations
2. Tween animations

## physics-based animations

this is used to mimic real-world behavior i.e when an object hits the ground, it will bounce and continue moving forward, but with each bounce it will slow down and start having smaller rebounds and eventually stop.

## Tween animations

this is a short-form of in-between animations. Animations has starting points and ending points, a timeline and speed of transition.

this framework automatically calculates the animation transition from starting point to ending point

## Animated container - AnimatedContainer widget

this is a container that gradually changes over time

it has the following arguments:

1. duration
2. curve
3. color
4. height
5. width
6. child
7. decoration
8. transform
