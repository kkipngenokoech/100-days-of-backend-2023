# operators

it can be to perform:

1. arithmetic expression
   1. +
   2. -
   3. /
   4. *
2. equality expression & relational expression
   1. ==
   2. !=
   3. >
   4. >=
   5. <
   6. <=
3. type test expression
   1. as - typecast like import prefixes `import 'travelpoints.dart' as travel;`
   2. is - if the objects contains the specified type, it evaluates to true if (points is Places) = true
   3. is! - If the object contains the specified type, it evaluates to false (not usually used).
4. assignment expression
   1. = - assigns a value 
   2. ??= - Assigns value only if variable being assigned to has a value of null
   3. +=
   4. -=
   5. /=
   6. *=
5. Logical operators
   1. ! - ! is a logical 'not'. Returns the opposite value of the variable/expression.
   2. && - && is a logical 'and'. Returns true if the values of the variable/expression are all true.
   3. || - ! is a logical 'or'. Returns true if at least one value of the variable/expression is true.
6. conditional expression
   1. condition? value1 :value2 - If the condition evaluates to true, it returns value1. If the condition evaluates to false, it returns value2. The value can also be obtained by calling methods.
7. cascade notation (..)
   1. .. - The cascade notation is represented by double dots (..) and allows you to make a sequence of operations on the same object.
