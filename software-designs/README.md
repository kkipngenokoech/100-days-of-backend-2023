# Patterns

the are reuasable solutions to common problems that occur during software design and dev

we need patterns because we don't want to reinvent the wheel

## design patterns

design patterns for object oriented programs are divided into:

1. creational
2. structural
3. Behavioral

## [creational](./creationalpatterns.md)

related to how objects are constructed from classes

it comes with powerful suggestions of how well/best to encapsulate object creation process in a program

1. builder pattern
2. protoype pattern
3. singletons pattern
4. Abstract pattern

## structural pattern

concerned with the composition of classes i.e how classes are made/constructed

1. Adapter pattern
2. Bridge pattern
3. Composite pattern
4. Decorators pattern
5. Facade pattern
6. Flyweight pattern
7. Proxy pattern

## Behavioural pattern

this dictate how interactions of classes and objects amongst each other and the delegation of responsibility

1. intepreter pattern
2. template pattern
3. chain of responsibility pattern
4. iterator pattern
5. mediatior pattern
6. memento pattern
7. observer pattern
8. state pattern
9. strategy pattern
10. visitor pattern
